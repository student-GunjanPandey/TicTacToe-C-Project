# TicTacToe-C-Project
Mini Project - Tic Tac Toe Game implemented using C language.
# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This is a mini project developed as part of my B.Tech CSE curriculum. It is a two-player terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game written in the C programming language.

## 🛠️ Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay (X and O)
- Simple text-based interface using terminal
- Winner detection logic
- Option to track scores across rounds
- Clean, modular code structure with functions

## 📸 Sample Output

X | O | X
-----------
 O | X | 6
-----------
 7 | O | X

==> Player X wins this round!
Score => X: 1, O: 0


## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using arrays and loops for game mechanics
- Writing modular code in C using functions
- Basic game logic and decision-making
- CLI-based user interaction and input handling

## 💻 How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `TicTacToe.c`
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the file directory
3. Compile the program using:
4. 4. Run the executable:
